        <h2>let's quickly see, what is git?</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">Git is a version control system which is freely available. It helps in tracking your
            projects and keeping them organized.</p>

        <h2>prerequisites</h2>
        <p class="blog-text">You must have downloaded the git on your system, then just open the terminal and go to your
            git directory.</p>

        <h2>we are good to go now!</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>
                <h3>git pull</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It will pull all the updates from the server into your local machine. By doing it,
                    we are downloading all the changes( most likely done by your other team members) and making your
                    code updated with the latest one present on the server. It's just like we sync our google accounts
                    on different devices so that we are provided with updated information.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git status</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It basically tells the state of your repository and would provide the following
                    information:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>
                        <p>It lets you know about your current branch in which you are working.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It enlists the modified files. It informs you if there are any changes in the existing files
                            that are not yet committed to git.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It tells you about untracked files i.e. which are on your local machine and yet not committed
                            to git.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git diff</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It will enlist all changes in all files.The code which has been removed will be
                    displayed in red.The new code which has been added to the file will be displayed in green.</p>
                <p class="blog-text blog-note"><strong>git diff [filename] :- </strong>It will mention changes only in
                    that particular filename.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git checkout</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It is most commonly used to switch to a different branch. Another most common use
                    for checkout is when you want to restore the previous version of the file.</p>
                <h4>how to restore the version of file?</h4>
                <p class="blog-text">For e.g. you have done some changes in the file and save it, now if you check the
                    git status it will tell you list of modified files and will give you 2 suggestions:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                            If you want to add this file in your next commit then use git add “filename”.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you want to discard the changes, then use <strong>git checkout “filename”.</strong>
                            By doing checkout this file, it’s previous version will be restored on your local machine.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git add [filename]</h3>
                <p class="blog-text">It tells Git that you want to add this particular file into your next commit.
                    However, git add doesn't update the git repository until you run git commit.<br />It’s like you are
                    selecting the changes for which you will do a commit.(just like when you finalizes the products in
                    the supermarket by putting it in your cart , for which you will pay the bill)</p>
                <p class="blog-text">For e.g. if there are 3 untracked files, fileA, fileB, fileC, but you only want to
                    commit for fileA and fileB, so you first do git add fileA, then git add fileB, then do commit.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text blog-note"><strong>git add . :-</strong> it will add all modified files at once.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git commit -m 'message'</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It will commit all the changes added by git add command along with message.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>git push</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">It will push all the committed code to the server.</p>
            </li>

        </ol>
